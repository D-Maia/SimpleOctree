# SimpleOctree

This a simple from-scratch implementation of a 3D octree built for collision detection. I made it a while ago as a part of an experiment with several hundred thousand objects updating, to learn a bit more about collision detection, spatial partitioning, binary tree data structures, and recursiveness

This was made in C#, using the Monogame Framework and I was following a tutorial for a good part of it, adapting it to my needs as I went along.
